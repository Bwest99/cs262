An interesting application that I think is possible and interesting is a variant of a personal planner.
The basic idea is a note pad that auto-dates each new note with today's date and starts a checklist. Possible varients
of this checklist would allow for the user to enter dates and times, or to start a to-do style checklist. Other possible
avenues of features would be ways to track certain items, and once they're listed as gone, automatically add them to a shopping list.

An application that is simply an entertaining idea is a campus wide squirrel tracker.
I'm basing this off of an app rolled out by the state of Wisconsin that would let users log
squirrels, and what they were doing when spotted. I think this app is useless for any practical
use for the campus, but it would be a fun way to track our hordes of pseudo-domesticated squirrels
