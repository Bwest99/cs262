1. App.js contains the javascript for the entire application.

2. package.json is a file of metadata specifying dependencies for the project.

3. node_modules includes all of the files for NodeJS in the package. I assume that
they need to be included in the project itself for the app to properly work.

4. .gitignore actually wasn't downloaded for me, but going off of what I found on
google, its exactly what it sounds like, a collection of files that have been
marked to be ingnored by git commands.
